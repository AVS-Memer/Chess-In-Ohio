    <h1>Alternate Moves</h1>
    <p>There are many moves you can do other than moving pieces, which would still take up a move.</p>
    <h2>Special moves</h2>
    <h3>Castle</h3>
    <p>Move the king 2 spaces towards a rook. move the rook to the space between where the king was and the king is. The king and rook cannot have moved before this.</p>
    <h3>En Passant</h3>
    <p>If a pawn moves 2 spaces, the opponent's pawn can still capture the pawn by going to the space that the pawn skipped.</p>
    <h3>Sacrifice</h3>
    <p>Take 9 pawns and replace them with a chancellor. You can still do your move.</p>
    <h3>Resignation draw</h3>
    <p>If the resigner kills the king or last prince and they would normally lose, the game would become a draw.</p>
    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
    <p>The king and queen must be adjacent to each other for 2 moves, and you can declare when you want the process to begin. This counts as a move. The queen is unable to move for the next 10 moves, and there must be an open space next to the queen to make a prince, otherwise the prince is aborted.</p>
    <h3>Amazonian reproduction</h3>
    <p>Same Reproduction, but itâ€™s with the horseking and the amazon, where the amazon is unable to move for the next 15 moves and makes a son of the amazon.</p>

    <p>The opponent can only move one of the 6 original pieces from normal chess.</p>

    <h3>Wordle</h3>
    <p>You think of a 5 letter word. The opponent gets 6 chances to guess it. For every guess, If your opponent guesses it, they get a niftic, and you decide where you put it. If your opponent fails to guess it, you get an amazon, and your opponent decides where to put it, but they may not take it next move.</p>
    <h3>Spawn ducktif</h3>
    <p>You can place a ducktif somewhere. There have to be at least 2 squares without a ducktif on the board for you to put one.</p>

    <p>See who talks louder. The louder person will get a pawn-gouch.</p>
    <h3>Pawn combine</h3>
    <p>Flip a coin. If heads, take any 8 pawns and turn them into a zeta</p>
    <h3>Punch</h3>
    <p>Flip a coin. If heads, punch your opponent in the face. If tails, they get to punch you in the face.</p>
    <h3>Trash talk</h3>

    <h3>Llama bet</h3>
    <p>You say "llama betcha" and your opponent has to say the number of llamas you have in the next second. If they don't say it, all of your llamas obtain the ability to jump other pieces like a horse (they're still known as llamas)</p>
