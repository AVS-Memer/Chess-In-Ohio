    <h1>Pieces</h1>
    <p>There are many pieces in Chess in Ohio. They can do many different things. Some may require doing things other than moving other pieces.</p>
    <h2>Diagram</h2>
    <p>The diagram will be a rectangle of 0s of size depending on the piece's movement. The spot where the piece will be would be marked with a P, and the spot(s) where it can move would be marked with a #. The spots that can only be reached by taking a piece would be marked with an X. The spots that have to be empty would be marked with a Z. The spots with one of your other pieces would be marked with a B. If the piece can move along a line, it would be marked with a ^. If the piece can capture along a line, it would be marked with a V. If a piece can move along a line without capturing, it would be marked with a S. (Ex.):<br>0#0#0<br>#000#<br>00P00<br>#000#<br>0#0#0</p>
