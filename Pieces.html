The spot where the piece will be would be marked with a P, and the spot(s) where it can move would be marked with a #. The spots that can only be reached by taking a piece would be marked with an X. The spots that have to be empty would be marked with a Z. The spots with one of your other pieces would be marked with a B. If the piece can move along a line, it would be marked with a ^. If the piece can capture along a line, it would be marked with a V. If a piece can move along a line without capturing, it would be marked with a S.
